If you're looking for a **StudioRack alternative** now that **Waves SoundGrid Studio** is being phased out, **AudioGridder** is a great option. AudioGridder is a **free, open-source** plugin host that allows you to **offload VST, VST3, and AU plugins** to a remote server, much like StudioRack with SoundGrid.  

### **Why Use AudioGridder?**  
✅ **Low-Latency Plugin Processing** – Run CPU-heavy plugins on a separate machine.  
✅ **Multi-DAW Compatibility** – Works with most DAWs via VST, AU, and AAX.  
✅ **Cross-Platform** – Supports both **Windows & macOS**.  
✅ **Free & Open-Source** – No licensing fees or vendor lock-in.  

While it doesn’t offer the same level of Waves integration, **AudioGridder** is a solid alternative for offloading processing and reducing CPU load in both studio and live setups.
