### Bad ideas

- Vmware ESXI or other virtualisation solution : run but will also keep failing as the server need realtime usage, spend more time doing music geeks !
- Laptop server : as macbook pro or something else : as the server running the computer at fullspeed, it will make your computer die sooner ...


### Failed to work and will never be ...

- HP Elitedesk 400 G7 i5 10500 : CPU or lan recognition failed
- MSI B450M Mortar Max + Ryzen 3 1200
- MSI 790FX-GD70 + Phenom II X4 965
- Lenovo Thinkstation P340
- Non Intel CPU based configuration
- Non Intel or Some Realtek based NIC card


## FAQ

<details><summary>How do i check the CPU ?</summary>
<p>

I always take my [2013 CPU i7 4770](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/fr/fr/ark/products/75122/intel-core-i7-4770-processor-8m-cache-up-to-3-90-ghz.html)as reference.
It always had decent results on reverb test [creamware pulsar saturation on PCI Bus before](https://www.forums.scopeusers.com/viewtopic.php?t=17078&start=460) with the same result : around 10/11 reverbs.

When i need to check the "brut power" of a CPU for reference, i google "i7 4770 vs The other one cpuboss" and check rapidely on some site like [CPU Boss](http://cpuboss.com/) for benchmarck comparison or [passmark  comparison website](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/).

I check to have at least the same as the i7 4770 (or almost equivalent :  [i5 8500T](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/Intel-Core-i5-8500T-vs-Intel-Core-i7-4770/3231vs1907), [i7 4790](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/Intel-i5-8500T-vs-Intel-i7-4770-vs-Intel-i7-4790/3231vs1907vs2226)

Avoid Celeron, Intel I3 or too old CPU (before 2013), and be carefull with the reference : i6500 is NOT the same as i6500T (or K, S, T, U ....)

<details><summary>Which motherboard ?</summary>
<p>

For a long time as reference (on planetz : [creamware user](https://www.forums.scopeusers.com/viewtopic.php?t=17078&start=460)) : ASUS or GIGABYTE where the most reliable choice for a music computer.

<details><summary>How do i mesure performance of my setup ? (Reverb Test)</summary>
<p>

One of the mesure of setup performance (and does not reflect the whole CPU capabilities - see "[CPU Performance vs. Real-Time Performance in Digital Audio Workstations (DAW)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUsLLEkswzE)" for full explanation), is to test the worst case scenario for plugins use : reverbs.
Reverbs are often the most commun and worst for system resources.
This is why this is a commun reference.( see 2005 [Masterverb thread](https://forums.scopeusers.com/viewtopic.php?t=17078&sid=21d12edd7bac80c1b0427111224bc653))

A simple test you can do, as waves does :

1. create an audio track on your DAW, insert random wav on it
2. set studiorack plugin insert on this track, select H - Reverb plug in
3. play, if it's :
  - DOES NOT poping or other interference, duplicate and repeat until it does
  - DOES popin, your reach your max, count your track number : and this his the end of the test

[^test_result]: performance under studiorack @44khz
